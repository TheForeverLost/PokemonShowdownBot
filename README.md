## Introduction

So I have been a huge pokemon fan for a long time and [pokemon showdown](https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/) is a platform for competitive pokemon battling by smogon which is the largest open source organization for projects dealing with the world of pokemon

So with this project i wanted to use technologies i always wanted to try to make a browser extension that can act as a assistant in-battle and during teambuilding phase

I also plan to use web automation and AI/Ml to create a bot that will play the game as a CPU AI
