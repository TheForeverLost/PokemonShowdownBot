## Introduction

So I have been a huge pokemon fan for a long time and [pokemon showdown](https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/) is a platform for competitive pokemon battling by smogon which is the largest open source organization for projects dealing with the world of pokemon

So with this project i wanted to use technologies i always wanted to try to make a browser extension that can act as a assistant in-battle and during teambuilding phase

I also plan to use web automation and AI/Ml to create a bot that will play the game as a CPU AI

## Understanding the files

**PokemonShowdownAnalysis.ipynb**

Before any sort of project it was essential to understand how the entire project works as well as the 

dynamics of the game so this notebook extracts all possible data from smogon resources such as pokemon data , move data , battle records , image resources etc

**Extension**

Chrome Extension that will be used as an assistant in teambuilder
